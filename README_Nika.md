Title: ODAAS(Obtaining Data from an Aamino Acid Sequence)

Overview:
The idea of this program is to make life easier for experimenters and bioinformaticians working with amino acid sequences (both long and short). The ODAAS tool will allow you to quickly obtain 
various characteristics of your amino acid sequence. As input, this program can receive several sequences of amino acids (both in three-letter and one-letter form, str) and the name of the procedure 
that needs to be performed. Possible actions:
1. Name - Translation of a one-letter amino acid sequence into a three-letter one (for better visual perception), and the reverse operation
2. count_protein_length - obtaining the length of the amino acid sequence
3. count_disulfide_bonds - counting the possible number of disulfide bonds in the protein structure
4. count_molecular_weight - calculating the molecular weight of a protein
5. Name - counting the number of positive and negative amino acids in a protein
6. Name - counting hybrophobic amino acids in a protein
7. Name - a summary of all information about the sequence (the result of executing all functions).
At the output, the program produces one string or a list of strings if several amino acid sequences were supplied.
